### Submitting Code

1. **Check existing issues** — Look for open issues or create one before starting.
2. **Fork the repo** and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix
   ```
3. **Write your code** following the guidelines below.
4. **Write or update tests** for your changes.
5. **Run checks** before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```
6. **Commit** with a clear message (see Commit Convention).
7. **Push** and open a Pull Request.

## Branch Naming

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/short-description` | `feat/add-new-adapter` |
| Bug fix | `fix/short-description` | `fix/edge-case-error` |
| Docs | `docs/short-description` | `docs/update-api-guide` |
| Refactor | `refactor/short-description` | `refactor/simplify-core` |

## Commit Convention

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add new feature
fix: correct bug in module
docs: update configuration examples
test: add tests for edge case
refactor: simplify internal logic
chore: update dependencies
```

## Code Guidelines

- **TypeScript** — All source code in TypeScript. Maintain strict typing.
- **Tests** — Write tests using Jest. Aim for coverage on new code.
- **No breaking changes** without discussion — Open an issue first.
- **Keep it focused** — One PR = one concern.
- **Document public APIs** — Add JSDoc comments for exported functions and types.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the PR template completely.
2. Ensure all checks pass (tests, types, build).
3. Link the related issue (e.g., `Closes #12`).
